# GLAMHack 2022 Label Search

**This is a work in progress until 
prelimnary results will be presented on the GLAM Hack at Mendrisio 5th November 2023 around 3pm**

This repository contains the ideas, codes and the documentation for the [GLAM Hack Project Label Recognition for Herbaria](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/136). We focused on the collector "Walo Koch", therefor the hacking is fitting to this data.
For all data the further [method and goal](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/123) look at the formulations by the challenge provider 
[Alessia Guggisberg](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/user/AlessiaGuggisberg) - by the way thanks to her!

### Walo Koch and his labels
[Walo Koch](https://hls-dhs-dss.ch/fr/articles/031483/2006-08-14/
) (* 29th November 1896, Laufenburg; â€  18th July 1956, Poschiavo) is represented on the herbaria with handwritten
text and machinewritten one or is a stamp. Latter we have focused on.
Even there we have to distinguish between "leg. Walo Koch" (i.e. collector) and "det. Walo Koch" (i.e. determinator).
For creating a model with [escriptorium](https://gitlab.com/scripta/escriptorium) we fixed on the "leg. Walo Koch" labels.
