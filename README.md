# GLAM 2022 Label Search

**This is a work in progress.
Prelimnary results will be presented on the GLAM Hack at Mendrisio 5th November 2023 around 3pm**

This repository contains the ideas, codes and the documentation for the [GLAM Hack Project Label Recognition for Herbaria](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/136). We focused on the collector "Walo Koch", therefor the hacking is fitting to this case.
For all data the further [method and goal](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/project/123) is formulated by the challenge provider 
[Alessia Guggisberg](https://hack.glam.opendata.ch/user/AlessiaGuggisberg) - by the way thanks to her!

### Walo Koch and his labels
Walo Koch (* 29th November 1896, Laufenburg; â€  18. Juli 1956, Poschiavo) is represented on the herbaria with handritten
text and machinewritten. Latter we have focused on.
Even there we have to distinguish between "leg. Walo Koch" and "det. Walo Koch".
For creating a model with escriptorium we fixed on the "leg. Walo Koch" labels.
